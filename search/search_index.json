It is a security measure which you will have to temporarily or permanently adjust to allow running of our script.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Three Ways to Allow a Script</p> </li> </ol> Scope Command Effect For this specific Command <code>-ExecutionPolicy Bypass</code> flag Maximum security. Used alongside a command that will call the script and only works for that command. For this PowerShell Session <code>Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process...</code> Effect lasts until you close the currently opened PowerShell window. Permanent for Current User <code>Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser...</code> Allows scripts to be run at any time. Closing and reopening Powershell, as well as a PC restart, will not reset the settings. <ol> <li>Running the Script: In Practice:</li> </ol> <p>Method A (For this Specific Command):  </p> <p>inside powershell</p> <p>powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File \"C:\\Path\\To\\Script\\RemoveEmptyFolders.ps1\"  </p> <p>The <code>powershell</code> command here is used to call the script.  </p> <p>Method B (For this Session): Open Powershell, change the policy for the current window and then run the script.    </p> <p>inside powershell, first we need to allow running of scripts for this session by running the below command:</p> <p>Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass</p> <p>then, we need to call the script by providing the full path to it, like this:</p> <p>\"C:\\Path\\To\\Script\\RemoveEmptyFolders.ps1\"  </p> <p>Method C (Permanent): Run Powershell using the Administrator rights and run the following command:  </p> <p>Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned  </p> <p>This will essentially allow you to re-enter the PowerShell window, reboot your PC and still be able to run <code>.ps1</code> scripts at will.

Add that folder to your <code>PATH</code>: - Using the searchbar, navigate to <code>Environment Variables</code> - Click on <code>Environment Variables</code> - Select a variable called <code>Path</code> inside the <code>User variables</code> interface and click <code>Edit</code> - Click <code>New</code> and add (copy &amp; paste) the full path to your script's folder - Click <code>OK</code> twice - once after adding the path and then to apply changes 3.
